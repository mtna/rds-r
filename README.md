## Overview

This R library facilitates access and integration with MTNA [Rich Data Services](http://www.richdataservices.com) API, enabling immediate access to RDS backed datasets and metadata collections. RDS provides on-premises or cloud based solution for concurrently accessing, querying, tabulating, and packaging data and metadata through a flexible REST API. 

<a name="why"></a>
## Why RDS?
Retrieving data and metadata for analytical, reporting, or visualization purposes is typically a time and resource consuming process that involves several steps such as:
-   Locating and downloading the data
-   Converting and load into R
-   Computing subsets or aggregation
-   Finding relevant documentation
-   Manually transcribing codes/classification/labels and other descriptive elements into R objects

RDS simplifies this process by offeing a REST API to perform all of the above in *a single step*! No need to download data, convert across formats, spend hours skimming though cryptic PDF/Excel/Word and other legacy files for documentation.

RDS combines on the fly querying and tabulation capabilities with metadata retrieval features. Comprehensive variable and classification metadata can accompany any data queried through RDS, enabling immediate reuse and rendering. 

Visit the RDS web site for detailed informtion on the platform capabilities or learn more about how to complement and deliver your data to you users.
