\arguments{
\item{url}{The base URL of the RDS server}

\item{collection}{The collection ID}

\item{view}{The view ID}

\item{cols}{The columns to select}

\item{where}{Describes how to subset the records}

\item{orderby}{Describes how the results should be ordered}

\item{distinct}{Specifies that only distinct values should be returned}

\item{limit}{Specifies the number of records to return}

\item{offset}{Specifies the starting index of the records}

\item{colLimit}{Specifies the limit of classifications that should be returned}

\item{colOffset}{Specifies the starting index of the classifications to be returned}

\item{classLimit}{Specifies the limit of classifications that should be returned}

\item{classOffset}{Specifies the starting index of the classifications to be returned}

\item{codeLimit}{Specifies the limit of codes that should be returned in each classification}

\item{codeOffset}{Specifies the starting indexes of the codes in each classification}

\item{facts}{Specifies that any facts available should be included in the returned metadata}

\item{freqs}{Specifies that any frequencies available should be included in the returned metadata}

\item{stats}{Specifies that any summary statistics available should be included in the returned}

\item{count}{Specifies that the total count of records in the view should be included in the info section}

\item{varProperties}{Specifies the variable properties to include / exclude from the returned variable metadata. Can be a regex or property names.}

\item{key}{API key for views that require a key.}

\item{inject}{Specifies if metadata should be injected into the data frame. If true and there are classifications available the columns codes will be replaced with code values. Defaults to FALSE}

\description{
This function allows you to use the select function of RDS. RDS typically gives out a limited amount of 
data to keep the service quick and efficient. This select function will query RDS as many times as needed
to compile and return the entire data set to the R user.
